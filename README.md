# ECE - Robust Control
This course, taught by Associate Professor [Charalampos Bechlioulis](https://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/ece-faculty/bechlioulis-charalambos.html), is part of the 8th semester curriculum at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras.
Throughout the semester, we were assigned four practical exercises, which I have included in this Git repository.
